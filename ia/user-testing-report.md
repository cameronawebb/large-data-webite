## Individual Results & Observations

### Andy Ham

### Seita Goto

- He did exactly what was expected for the user to do.
- Seemed a little slow looking for the articles on the home page. I may need to make thosemore obvious.
- Looks good.
- Seperate some of the articles more on the home page, this will discrimate them from just being more text on the home page and recognized as actual articles.

## Trends

### Critical, Needs Fixing, Unable to Complete

- Everything worked and wasn't critical it was more recommendations of changes.
- Add buttons for home page articles, drop down menu.

### Serious, Causes Frustration, May Hinder Completion

- Everyone recommended; better use of buttons and space on mini articles on home page.
- etc.

### Minor, Annoying, Wonâ€™t Hinder Completion

- Buttons and drop down menus for the home page should be changed or reviewed.
