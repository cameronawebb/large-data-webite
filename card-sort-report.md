## Observations

- Did the participants have any common comments?
	- They both had mentioned they had seemed fairly easy to catagorize. This could be because there are less catagories then there are actual plants and information on them.
- Did they have questions that stood out?
	- Not Really.
- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics?
	- No one had mentioned that they had.
- Did they find common groupings? Or were the groupings completely different?
	In both situations the groupings ended up being the exact same.
- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?
	 Not so much, I wasn't really sure what to expect to be fair. Though I feel the were organized appropriately to what was there.
- Were the results similar to your expectations?
	As mentioned before I wasn't really sure what to expect.
- How did you feel while watching them perform the task?
	- I didn't really feel anthing curiousity if anything as to how they were going to be organized.
